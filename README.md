## Project 1 : The Higgs boson

This project contains two important files : 
- implementations.py contains all the implementations required for the first project
- run.ipynb contains the best classifier implementation we managed to create.

The data for the project goes in the data/ folder, which we do not include.
The helpers are the ones provided and are not modified.

### The implementation

The implementation we display here replaces the unseen data by the mean of the columns, and expands both polynomially, using a sine function and a log. Further details are in the report.
